 - Text new data and press "after" or "before" to add new blocks
 - Or open a .txt file with blocks
 - Also you can save it in a textfile

## A format of the textfile
 - Strings start with "Block " are counting as blocks
 - Next params should be in the next format: (data=<data>,x=<x-position>,y=<y=position>,w=<width>,h=<height>)
 - Example: Block: (data=21.01.2012,x=100,y=100,w=100,h=40)
